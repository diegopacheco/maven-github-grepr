STATUS: initial development and test phase, nothing concrete yet.

This project has a simply and small goal. 

The idea is you can assemble dependencies from maven project while
their are on github and don't have maven repositories. If you are looking for a plugin to deploy
maven projects on github you may want take a look at kevinpollet 
maven-github-plugin(https://github.com/kevinpollet/maven-github-plugin).

So the plugin will download the sources for you and compile and build it. Simple and easy, no need to
have a github account, just put the git url and have fun.
